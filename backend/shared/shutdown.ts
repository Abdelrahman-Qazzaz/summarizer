/**
 * Runs `drain` on SIGTERM/SIGINT, then exits.
 *
 * Orchestrators send SIGTERM and SIGKILL some seconds later, so a drain that
 * hangs must not be the thing that decides how long a deploy takes: the hard
 * exit is a backstop, not a fallback path.
 *
 * Both processes are safe to kill outright — an unacked message is redelivered
 * and reclaimed under its fencing token, and a chat turn completes server-side
 * independently of the response stream. Draining is about not wasting work
 * that was nearly finished, not about correctness.
